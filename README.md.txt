We want to develop a currency converter using javascript, html and css that queries the current daily exchange ratesand allows
 the user to select the currencies and input an amount to convert.
 
 
1.	See the image below for reference 
2.	The design should try to match the image below
3.	Behaviour considerations
a.	User can select currencies to convert from and to using the dropdowns in the image below
b.	A user can input a value on the left box and the value will be automatically converted to the appropriate currency value on the right
c.	Or a user can input a value on the right and will automatically be converted to the other currency on the left
d.	Responsive behaviour is up to you to define 
e.	Currency symbols inside the boxes are optional, same as flags inside the currency dropdown
4.	Exchange rates will be obtained querying the following service:
http://www.ecb.europa.eu/stats/eurofxref/eurofxref-daily.xml

5.	The currencies we will be able to select, are the ones present in the above service
